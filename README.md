# Intrada

A **practice notebook** for musicians, built with [Crux](https://redbadger.github.io/crux/) for cross-platform Rust. Build a session from your music library, group and reorder what you'll practise, play it through with a timer and rep counting, and score how it went. Organised as three pillars — **Plan** (decide what to practise), **Practice** (play with intention), and **Track** (see the process working).

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for direction, `just status` for what's in flight right now, and [`VISION.md`](VISION.md) for the research foundation. (A practice-coach direction was built July to August 2026 and reversed; its design record lives in [`specs/intrada-practice-coach-design.md`](specs/intrada-practice-coach-design.md), bannered.)

The only platform is the **native SwiftUI iOS app**, offline-first: on-device SQLite is the source of truth and the app works fully with no network and no account. A Leptos web shell and Tauri iOS host previously shared this core; both were removed in 2026-07 (see [`docs/rebuild-review.md`](docs/rebuild-review.md)), and the app has been native-iOS-only since.

```

Intrada follows the **Crux pure-core pattern**: `intrada-core` contains all business logic with zero side effects. Events go in, effects come out. The native SwiftUI shell is a dumb pipe: it sends `Event`s, fulfils persistence effects via GRDB, and renders the `ViewModel`. No domain logic lives in Swift.

- **Shell**: SwiftUI (iOS 17.0+), bindings generated via UniFFI + facet typegen
- **Core**: Crux 0.20 (Rust), zero I/O
- **Database**: on-device GRDB/SQLite, local-first

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (2021 edition) via [rustup](https://rustup.rs); the pinned
  toolchain is in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Do not also install Rust from Homebrew:
  `/opt/homebrew/bin` sits ahead of `~/.cargo/bin` on a default PATH, so the brew
  `cargo` shadows rustup, ignores the pin, and has no iOS targets
- [cargo-swift](https://github.com/antoniusnaumann/cargo-swift) at exactly
  0.9.0 (`cargo install cargo-swift --version =0.9.0`); its bundled
  uniffi-bindgen matches our uniffi 0.29.4 runtime, and newer releases crash
  the app with a contract mismatch
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (`brew install just` or `cargo install just`)
- Xcode 26+, iOS 17.0+ target, [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`), and the iOS Simulator runtime (Xcode → Settings → Platforms → iOS Simulator)

Git hooks (a pre-push check that refuses pushes onto an already-merged PR
branch) install automatically in Claude Code sessions; for other shells run
`bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` once (sets `core.hooksPath = .githooks`;
bypass a specific push with `SKIP_PR_CHECK=1 git push`, opt out entirely with
`git config --unset core.hooksPath`).

Forking this repo: update the development team in `ios/project.yml` to your
own Apple Team ID (developer.apple.com → Membership, or Xcode → Settings →
Accounts).

## Quick start

The app is offline-first: everything works with no network and no account.

```bash
just ios
# → regenerates Swift bindings if the core changed, then opens Xcode; Cmd+R
```

## Available commands

Run `just` to see all commands. Key ones:

```bash
# Quality
just test         # Run all tests
just lint         # Run clippy
just fmt          # Format code
just check        # fmt-check + clippy + tests + hygiene (mirrors CI)

# iOS (native SwiftUI)
just ios              # Regenerate bindings (if core changed) + open in Xcode
just ios-run          # Build + launch on a simulator + screenshot (seeds demo data)
SEED=0 just ios-run   # …launch against your real on-device data instead of demo data
just ios-test         # Build + run the snapshot/unit test suite (fast tier)
just ios-test-full    # …+ XCUITests (full gate; what ship/CI run before merge)
```

```

## Data storage

- **On-device (GRDB/SQLite)**: local-first source of truth for items and sessions — the app works fully offline. `updated_at` + soft-delete tombstones on every table.
- **iOS UserDefaults**: crash-recovery of an in-progress session, and the persisted library sort order.
- **IDs**: client-minted ULIDs.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push:

- **PR checks**: test, clippy, fmt, security & hygiene, native iOS build + snapshot tests
- **Push to main**: all checks + native iOS release build (TestFlight lane runs separately on tag/dispatch)
