# specs/ what is live and what is not

The 2026-07 practice-coach pivot was reversed on 2026-08-13 (#1344): the coach
was removed and the session builder restored. Most specs here are therefore
records of shipped behaviour rather than current plans, and carry a banner
saying so. **This index is the fast answer to "can I implement from this
document?"** Where a spec's own banner and this table disagree, this table wins,
because a spec's header is written once and this table is reviewed.

Every top-level `.md` in this folder appears in exactly one section below. A
spec that does not appear here has not been classified, which is a gap to fix
rather than a licence to implement. Files inside a spec's own subfolder
(`<spec>/design/`, and `reflection-loop/spec.md`) travel with their parent and
are not listed separately.

Companion documents outside this folder:
[`docs/roadmap.md`](../docs/roadmap.md) (direction and phase order) and
`just status` (what is in flight, read from GitHub).

## Live, the current design

Accurate about how the app works or is being built now.

| Spec | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`session-builder-revert.md`](session-builder-revert.md) | **The 2026-08 revert.** Restores the session builder and removes the coach machinery (#1344). The decision that set the current product shape |
| [`native-ios.md`](native-ios.md) | The SwiftUI shell on the Crux core, the only shell. Its offline-first decisions are now enforced through `.claude/rules/offline-first.md`, which is where the invariants live; the paid-sync framing survives only here |
| [`ios-testflight-cicd.md`](ios-testflight-cicd.md) | Signing, match, the release lane (`.github/workflows/release-testflight.yml`) |
| [`key-modality.md`](key-modality.md) | Tonic plus major/minor instead of a free-text key (`Modality` in `domain/item.rs`) |
| [`library-sort.md`](library-sort.md) | Sorting the library list (`LibrarySort` in `domain/types.rs`) |
| [`exercise-relations.md`](exercise-relations.md) | The single "Used in" list replacing the related-to breadcrumb (`UsedInCard.swift`) |
| [`piece-related-exercises.md`](piece-related-exercises.md) | Writing your own exercise as the first action when adding exercises to a piece (`LibraryDetailScreen.swift`) |
| [`practice-instruments.md`](practice-instruments.md) | The Focus Player's timer, rep counter and honest click (`click_sounding` in `domain/session.rs`) |
| [`up-next-card.md`](up-next-card.md) | The "Up next" suggestion on the Practice tab (`compute_up_next` in `suggestion.rs`) |
| [`getting-cold-signal.md`](getting-cold-signal.md) | Weighting the "not practised in a while" signal by how well learned a piece is (`staleness.rs`) |
| [`api-removal.md`](api-removal.md) | The 2026-09-12 decision to remove the API and the sync, account and MCP-token client code (#1746, #1749); what went, what stays, what Jon tears down by hand |
| [`profile.md`](profile.md) | The musician's name, instrument, icon and highlighter colour, held on the device (`domain/profile.rs`, `AppEffect::SaveProfile`). Shipped across #1691 and #1692 |

## Planned, designed and not finished

| Spec | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`piece-from-photo.md`](piece-from-photo.md) | Adding a piece from a photograph of the page. Phases A, B and C shipped (#1443, #1455, #1476); Phase D unstarted (#1355, #1387) |
| [`one-pass-create.md`](one-pass-create.md) | Adding a piece with its chord chart and exercises in one save. Core landed 2026-09-07 (#1390, PR #1591) and `ItemEvent::AddPieceInFull` has no caller in `ios/Intrada` yet: this is the screens half of a two-PR split, still owed |
| [`picker-core-sort.md`](picker-core-sort.md) | The linked-item picker sheet's sort and search calling into the core instead of a Swift copy. Core landed on main (`sort_and_filter_candidates` in `app.rs`, `sort_and_filter_picker_candidates` in `intrada-ffi`, #1653, #1662); the screens half wiring `LinkedItemPickerSheet` to it and deleting the Swift copies is #1664, open |
| [`exercise-variations.md`](exercise-variations.md) | Variations defined on the exercise, and a session recording what was actually played (#1739). Phase A (core) and Phase B (the player's variation picker and the item-complete sheet) shipped; Phase C is open. Supersedes decisions 4 and 5 of `exercise-variants.md` |

## Shipped record, verify against the code before extending

Builder-era specs whose surfaces returned with the restored session builder.
Treat them as history of how the behaviour came to be, not as an implementation
contract.

| Spec | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`chart-to-scaffold.md`](chart-to-scaffold.md) | Chord-chart parsing and scaffold derivation (`domain/chart.rs`). Phase C shipped in PR #1111. The twelve-key ladder originally scoped inside it is still open as #1107, and that issue records that the steps mechanism it needs has since shipped, so the old #1083 blocker is gone |
| [`exercise-variants.md`](exercise-variants.md) | Exercise steps and the per-step ladder (`domain/variant.rs`) |
| [`session-block-grouping.md`](session-block-grouping.md) | Grouping and reordering blocks in the builder (`group_id`, `UngroupBlock`). Shipped via #1022, which the spec itself does not cite |
| [`piece-linked-exercises.md`](piece-linked-exercises.md) · [`piece-linked-exercises-design-brief.md`](piece-linked-exercises-design-brief.md) | The original piece-linked exercises (#1015). Its "Linked exercises" copy has since been renamed twice; read `exercise-relations.md` and `piece-related-exercises.md` for current behaviour |
| [`related-exercises-redesign.md`](related-exercises-redesign.md) | Related-exercises stocktake. Its "already shipped" inventory is stale: the exercise detail's "Related to" breadcrumb it lists was replaced by the "Used in" list. The Focus Player still shows one (`FocusPlayerScreen.swift`), which `exercise-relations.md` keeps deliberately |
| [`reflection-loop/`](reflection-loop/) | The reflection loop's core model |
| [`track-exercises-per-piece/`](track-exercises-per-piece/) | Per-piece exercise tracking |
| [`native-player.md`](native-player.md) · [`native-ios-player.md`](native-ios-player.md) | The Focus Player, as two sequential phases (#932 spine, #948 persistence) |
| [`priority-items.md`](priority-items.md) | Priority items replacing Goals in the Plan layer. Landed across #739 and #769, with #981 as its slice 2 |

## Historical, do not implement from these

Kept as a design record. Every one of these targets a shell or a crate that no
longer exists, or a direction that was reversed, so the code they describe
cannot be found and should not be recreated from them.

| Spec | Why |
|---|---|
| [`intrada-practice-coach-design.md`](intrada-practice-coach-design.md) | The retired coach design, built through Phase 2b and removed 2026-08-13 (#1344) |
| [`intrada-coach-engine.md`](intrada-coach-engine.md) | The retired coach engine, same removal. Recover code from commit 071b85b. None of `CoachState`, `MasteryStore` or `JudgementStore` exist |
| [`design-system.md`](design-system.md) | **The Leptos web shell's dark glassmorphism system**, per its own first line. `crates/intrada-web` was deleted in #1133. The live system is `design/intrada-design-system.dc.html` with `Theme.swift` canonical, both outside `specs/` |
| [`design-refresh-2026.md`](design-refresh-2026.md) | A refresh of that same web theme, written before native iOS existed. None of `AccentRow`, `StatCard` or `DifficultyDots` exist anywhere in the tree |
| [`onboarding-welcome.md`](onboarding-welcome.md) | A first-run carousel for the deleted web shell; the surface did not return |
| [`background-audio-plugin.md`](background-audio-plugin.md) | Written as a Tauri plugin under `crates/intrada-mobile`, which no longer exists. The reference `BackgroundAudioPlugin.swift` was removed in #1745; recover it from the commit before that change in `main`'s history (`git log --diff-filter=D -- ios/Reference/`). Useful as reference for a native port, not implementable as written |
| [`live-activity-plugin.md`](live-activity-plugin.md) | Same: an ActivityKit design as a Tauri plugin in a deleted crate. Its reference Swift was removed in #1745 too; same recovery route. A native lock-screen spec does not exist yet |

[`_archive/`](_archive/) holds the numbered SpecKit-era folders and retired
single-file specs (`seo-prerender.md`, `mcp-server.md`,
`account-settings-and-deletion.md`: the last two targeted the removed API,
#1746), and is excluded from the knowledge graph. Do not run `/speckit-*`
commands.
