# Retiring the five session fields nothing can set (#1766, #1374)

Status: decided 2026-09-13 (Jon, option "gone for good"). This spec rides as
the first commit of the shell PR and records why, what goes, the order, and
what stays in the database.

## Decision

A practice session carried five optional fields nothing on screen can set
any more:

- `session_intention`: the one-line "what this session is for", typed before
  starting in the spring quick-start flow (#266), last shown in the
  past-session detail (#1580), no screen reads or writes it now.
- `target_duration_mins`: the minutes target from the quick-start presets,
  gone with them.
- `reflection_improved`, `reflection_still_rough`, `reflection_next_target`:
  the three optional boxes on Session Complete (#1079), removed from the
  screen by the v0.7.0 audit (#1368) as admin the musician did not want.

They still travel through the core, the crash-recovery snapshot, four view
types on the bridge, the on-device `session` table and its mapping in
`LibraryStore`. Every session is saved with them empty, and the next reader
of the core has to work out whether they matter. They do not. If a session
goal or reflection returns, the July design brief wanted a different shape
from three text boxes, so it brings its own fields and its own migration.
Code with no reader gets deleted, not parked (#1176); git is the parking
space and this document names the recovery point.

## What goes, in order

Two PRs, shell first, because the shell reads the fields off the persistence
payload: removing them from the core first would break the Swift build.

### PR 1, the shell (branch `retire-session-fields-1766`)

- `ios/Intrada/Core/LibraryStore.swift`: the five columns leave the
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statement and the row-to-session mapping. The
  columns stay in the schema. No migration is added: the rule in
  `.claude/rules/offline-first.md` is additive by default, and dropping a
  column needs a copy-table migration nobody benefits from. A column that is
  never read or written is inert.
- `ios/IntradaTests`: `LibraryStoreMigrationTests` and `LibraryStoreTests`
  stop asserting the five columns round-trip; the upgrade-path test that a
  v7 database still opens stays. `PreviewSupport.swift` and any fixture stop
  naming the fields only once PR 2 removes them; in PR 1 they keep passing
  `nil`.
- Behaviour on screen: a past session saved back when an intention could be
  typed stops echoing it in its Practice history detail, one PR before the
  screen code goes. Nothing else changes and snapshot references do not, since
  the previews build their views directly.

### PR 2, the core and the bridge (same branch family, after PR 1 merges)

- `crates/intrada-core/src/domain/session.rs`: the fields leave
  `BuildingSession`, `ActiveSession` and `PracticeSession`; `ReflectionField`
  and `SessionEvent::UpdateSessionReflection` go with their handler and
  tests. `FinishSession` stays; it is tracked separately.
- `crates/intrada-core/src/model.rs`: the fields leave
  `BuildingSetlistView`, `ActiveSessionView`, `SummaryView` and
  `PracticeSessionView`; the mappers in `app.rs` stop filling them.
- `crates/intrada-core/src/domain/types.rs` and `analytics.rs`: fixtures
  and the bincode round-trip test drop the fields.
- `crates/intrada-core/src/persistence.rs`: the session payload no longer
  carries them.
- Crash recovery: `ActiveSession` is inside the snapshot blob, so its shape
  changes. `Store.sessionInProgressKey` in `ios/Intrada/Core/Store.swift`
  goes from `v3` to `v4` first, then the pinned blob test is re-recorded
  (#1345). A practice in progress at the moment of upgrade is discarded,
  which is the documented cost of a key bump; nothing saved is touched.
- Bindings regenerated through the `just` recipe; `ios/Intrada` compiles
  with no reference to the five names; `PreviewSupport.swift` fixtures drop
  the arguments.
- Tests that only exercised the fields are deleted and listed in the PR
  body; tests of the surrounding write path stay and pass.

## What stays

- The four columns in the on-device `session` table, and any text Jon typed
  into the reflection boxes between June and August. Invisible since #1368,
  untouched by this change, recoverable with `sqlite3` if ever wanted.
- Migrations `v3_session`, `v7_session_reflections` and `v15_reflection_steer`
  as history; append-only, never edited.
- `FinishSession` and the per-item reflection sheet (the tap verdicts and
  step picker), which are a different feature and are in use.

## Order and gates

PR 1: `just check`, `just ios-fmt-check`, `just ios-test-full`, reviewer
named on the schema and the persistence mapping. PR 2: the same, plus the
reviewer named on the bridge and the `ActiveSession` blob, and `just ios-run`
with `SEED=0` to prove a saved session from before the change still opens
from Practice history.

## Recovery

`git log --diff-filter=D -S reflection_next_target -- crates ios` finds both
PRs' commits; the commit before PR 2 in `main`'s history holds the last
version of every field, event and view type.
