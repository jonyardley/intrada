# intrada — Product Roadmap

*This is a vision and prioritisation doc, not a project plan. For what's
actually shipping right now, see [`status.md`](status.md) (one screen, updated
per PR), the [project board](https://github.com/users/jonyardley/projects/2)
and [open issues](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/issues).*

> ## ⚠️ THE 2026-07 COACH PIVOT WAS REVERSED (2026-08-13)
>
> Between July and August 2026 the product direction was the **practice
> coach**: the app decided what you practised, gated every block on evidence,
> and told you when you were done. It was built through Phase 2b and then
> **removed on 2026-08-13** (#1344): the direction went too far too fast, and
> the call was to restore the session-builder product. The coach code is
> recoverable from commit 071b85b; the design record stays in
> [`specs/intrada-practice-coach-design.md`](../specs/intrada-practice-coach-design.md)
> and [`specs/intrada-coach-engine.md`](../specs/intrada-coach-engine.md)
> (both bannered), the assessment that drove the pivot in
> [`docs/rebuild-review.md`](rebuild-review.md), and the machine-listening
> spike findings in [`segmentation-findings.md`](segmentation-findings.md).
>
> What the product does today is the restored builder flow: build a session
> from the library, group and reorder, play it through the Focus Player,
> reflect on the summary. **What direction it grows in next is an open
> question** — the rethink follows the revert. Issues parked under
> [`superseded-by-pivot`](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/labels/superseded-by-pivot)
> (#1087, #1101, #1107) are eligible again but stay parked until that
> conversation happens.

## How to read this doc

intrada serves the five layers of the [Product Vision](../VISION.md):
**Capture → Plan → Space → Show → Guide**. The layers build on each other
— you can't schedule what you haven't captured, can't space what you
haven't scheduled, can't show progress on what you haven't tracked.

The roadmap is also organised around three activity pillars — **Plan**
(decide what to practise), **Practice** (play with intention), and
**Track** (see the process working) — that cut across the layers.

This doc names the layers, pillars, and prioritisation principle.
**Issues on the [project board](https://github.com/users/jonyardley/projects/2)
are the source of truth for scope and timing.** When this doc and the
issues disagree, the issues are right.

---

## Where the product is today

Capture, Plan, Space (manual), and Show (analytics) all have working
surfaces. Auth, library, sessions, routines, scoring, focus mode, tempo
tracking, design system, multi-device shell, E2E tests — all done. The
native SwiftUI iOS app (on the Crux core — see
[`specs/native-ios.md`](../specs/native-ios.md)) is the only shell; the
Leptos web app and the Tauri iOS host were **deleted** in #1133, not paused.

The active gaps are deeper Layer-1 capture (multi-key, sections, archive),
the Space layer (mastery decay, spaced repetition), and parts of Show
(timeline charts, calendar). Layer 5 (Guide / AI) is intentionally on the
horizon.

Filter `is:open is:issue` on the board to see what's currently in flight.

### Current focus (2026-08)

The coach pivot is reversed (see the banner at the top); the restored
session-builder product is current. The immediate work is the revert's
follow-ups and the product rethink. See [`status.md`](status.md) and the
[project board](https://github.com/users/jonyardley/projects/2)
for what's actually in flight.

## Three pillars

### Plan — "Decide what to practise"

Before the instrument comes out. Building sessions, organising the
library, and eventually letting the app decide for you. Spans Layers 1
(Capture), 2 (Plan), and 3 (Space).

→ [`pillar:plan`](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/labels/pillar%3Aplan)

### Practice — "Play with intention"

Instrument is out. Timer running. The app stays out of the way and
supports focus, not admin. Lives mainly in Layer 4 (Show — encouragement,
feedback) with cross-cutting accessibility concerns.

→ [`pillar:practice`](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/labels/pillar%3Apractice)

### Track — "See the process working"

After the session. Analytics, insights, visualisation. Evidence the
practice is actually working. Mostly Layer 4 (Show); Layer 5 (Guide) when
AI work becomes timely.

→ [`pillar:track`](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/labels/pillar%3Atrack)

---

## Prioritisation principle

**Vision layer first, then pillar.** Layer 1 features take precedence
over Layer 2, which take precedence over Layer 3, and so on. Within a
layer, the three pillars advance independently.

The question is *"what's the most important thing I haven't captured
yet?"* before *"what's the smartest way to schedule it?"*

### Now / Next / Later in your head

- **Now** — a real musician hits a wall *because* this isn't built.
- **Next** — a real musician notices it's missing after a month of use.
- **Later** — the app could live without it for a year.

These are tags on issues, not buckets in this doc. They drift as work
ships and as we learn.

## Mobile shell — settled

The native SwiftUI app on the shared Crux core **is** the shell, and has been
since the 2026-05-31 decision completed: app-first, **local-first** (on-device
SQLite is the source of truth; Axum + Turso is a future sync target, not the live
read path). The Tauri 2 + Leptos WKWebView host and the Leptos web app were
deleted in #1133; two pieces of Swift worth reusing were mined into
`ios/Reference/` first — the background-audio session handling and a Live
Activity implementation.

See [`specs/native-ios.md`](../specs/native-ios.md) for the shell spec. Work
tracks under [`ios`](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/labels/ios).

Historical note: the sentences that used to live here ("the web app stays on
Leptos, untouched", "the Tauri shell stays shipping until parity") were true in
May and false by July. Statements about what is *currently* shipping belong in
one place — the banner at the top of this doc.

## Delivery model

### Labels

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pillar:plan` / `pillar:practice` / `pillar:track` | Activity pillar |
| `layer:capture` / `:plan` / `:space` / `:show` / `:guide` | Vision layer |
| `horizon:now` / `:next` / `:later` | Rough timing — 4 wk / 4–12 wk / 12+ wk |
| `architecture` | Technical debt, infrastructure |
| `ux` / `accessibility` | Cross-cutting |
| `security` | Security-relevant |
| `ios` | iOS-specific (native SwiftUI shell) |
| `epic` | Umbrella issue with sub-items |

### Board

[Project board](https://github.com/users/jonyardley/projects/2) columns
are workflow states (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done),
not categories. Use the labels above to filter and slice.

A `Priority` custom field (P0/P1/P2) ranks within a pillar/layer when
multiple items share the same horizon.

## Open questions

These are unresolved product questions. Each one likely produces issues
(or a Tier-3 spec) once answered.

1. **Metronome (re-opened 2026-08).** A native click shipped with the coach
   and was removed with it (#1344, recoverable from history). If the builder
   product wants a metronome, that code is the starting point.

2. **Offline-first architecture (resolved 2026-07).** The native app is
   offline-first by design — on-device SQLite is the source of truth, with
   test-enforced invariants (see CLAUDE.md). #41 closed. What remains is the
   future paid sync tier, deliberately deferred.

3. **Scoring + tempo coupling.** Should every mastery rating require a
   tempo? Or is tempo optional (only for items with tempo targets)?

4. **Teacher integration timing.** Currently a Layer-5 horizon. Basic
   sharing (routines, item suggestions) could come earlier without AI.
   The teacher-assignment capture (#267) addressed the immediate capture
   problem without teacher-facing features.

5. **Goals (re-resolved 2026-07-14).** History: goals were built twice
   (an early goals feature, removed in #213 for a ground-up redesign;
   then Goals #711–#740, removed in #769), with the lessons vertical
   (#273) in between, leaving the per-item `priority` flag (#765,
   `specs/priority-items.md`; priority UI and "neglected priority"
   signal tracked in #763 / #764). The vision/journey audit reopened the
   question: the ideal journey requires goals that *drive planning*, and
   the ruling is to rebuild them deliberately small: an outcome statement
   linked to library items with an optional target date, consumed by
   session planning, and none of the confidence/photo apparatus that sank
   the previous versions. The priority star stays as the zero-ceremony
   layer beneath. See VISION.md "The Scheduling Intelligence" and
   `docs/journeys.md` step 4.

6. **Lessons / photos / R2 surface (resolved 2026-07-14).** Rolled back:
   the lessons vertical was superseded by Goals in #711 (migrations
   0067–0068 dropped the lesson tables); Goals were then removed in #769
   (migrations 0081–0083). Nothing dormant remains, so #570 closes as
   part of the vision/journey audit. R2 photo storage hardening (#281)
   survives independently as a security item.
