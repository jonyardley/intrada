# intrada Tone of Voice

> Started 2026-08-14 (issue #1359, decision 1a of the
> [v0.7.0 audit](audit-2026-08.md)). This is the writing layer of
> [`design-principles.md`](design-principles.md): that doc decides what a screen
> *does*, this one decides what it *says*. When they disagree, the design
> principle wins and this doc gets a new example.
>
> **Scope: every string a user can read.** Screen titles, subtitles, buttons,
> labels, empty states, errors, alerts, accessibility labels, placeholder text.
> Not comments, not docs, not commit messages.

## How to use this doc

- Writing a new string? Read *The stance*, then check your string against
  *The rules*. Most strings are settled by rules 1 to 4 alone.
- A rule fights a real screen? That is a decision, not a licence. Settle it and
  append to *Decisions* rather than quietly writing around it.
- Reviewing copy? *The sweep checklist* at the bottom is the review pass.

## The stance

**intrada is a practice notebook, not a practice coach.** It holds what you
played and what you thought about it. It does not have opinions about your
playing, it does not cheer, and it does not have a personality that needs
expressing.

Three consequences, each one a design principle turned into a writing rule:

- **The app disappears during practice** ([§B](design-principles.md#b-simplicity--defer-complexity-dont-remove-capability)).
  On the player, words are as expensive as taps. Labels and numbers only.
- **Content over chrome** ([§C](design-principles.md#c-no-clutter--easy-to-reason-about)).
  The user's own pieces, sessions and scores are the content. App prose is
  chrome, so every sentence has to earn a place the user's data could have had.
- **One concept per screen** ([§C](design-principles.md#c-no-clutter--easy-to-reason-about)).
  A screen that needs a paragraph to explain itself is a design problem. Fix
  the screen, do not write a better paragraph.

The nearest thing to a house voice: **a good accompanist.** Present, precise,
never the thing you are listening to.

### Voice by surface

Adapted from [T13](design-principles.md#t13--voice-splits-by-surface-and-the-engine-never-speaks-on-screen),
which was retired with the coach but whose split survives the direction change.

| Surface | Job | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| **Chrome and admin** (headers, forms, library, builder, settings) | Name things | Labels, not sentences. A subtitle is facts, not a sales line. |
| **In session** (live view, player, rep counter) | Get out of the way | Numbers and one-word buttons. Prose only where nothing else works. |
| **Reflective** (session complete, reflection, item history) | Frame the user's own words | One short sentence at most; the user's quote carries the feeling. |

---

## The rules

### 1. British English, always

`practise` the verb, `practice` the noun. `prioritise`, `organise`, `colour`,
`favourite`, `cancelled`. Dates read `14 Aug`, never `Aug 14`.

Already right across the app (`Start practising`, `days practised`,
`Add to priorities`). It stays right by being checked.

### 2. A musician's words, not a data model's

Say what a musician would say at the piano. Where the core and the screen
disagree, the screen wins and the core keeps its own name.

| Core / spec says | Screen says |
|---|---|
| `variant` | Step |
| `entry`, `block` | the piece, the exercise, the group |
| `item type` | Piece / Exercise |
| `score`, `rating` (the 0 to 10) | Mark ([V4](#v4--the-screen-says-mark-the-core-keeps-score)) |
| BPM, quarter note | `♩ = 132`, crotchet |
| measure | bar |
| `session in progress` | Pick up where you left off? |

Music notation belongs on screen where a musician would write it: `♩ = 132`,
`D♭ major`, `bars 12 to 14`. Do not spell out what notation says more briefly.

### 3. Name the thing, do not narrate the app

The user knows they are in an app and knows the library is theirs. Every word
spent saying so is a word not spent on their music.

- No possessives on chrome: `Library`, not `Your Library`. `Exercises`, not
  `Your exercises`. Reflective surfaces are the exception, where the possessive
  points at the user's own words: see [V2](#v2--second-person-is-for-the-users-own-words-only).
- No verbs of navigation: never `View`, `Browse`, `Manage`, `Explore`.
- No screen introducing itself: never `This is where you...`.
- Buttons name the action and its object: `Add piece or exercise`,
  `Save session`. Not `Continue`, not `Get started`, not `Let's go`.

### 4. No AI-isms and no cheerleading

Banned outright, in any string:

- **Enthusiasm**: `Awesome`, `Great job`, `Well done`, `You're on fire`,
  `Nice work`, `Let's`, `Ready to`, `Time to`, any exclamation mark.
- **Marketing**: `seamlessly`, `effortlessly`, `powerful`, `unlock`, `elevate`,
  `curated`, `journey`, `empower`, `simply`, `just`.
- **Fake companionship**: `we` for the app (`We couldn't find...`), `I`,
  `Oops`, `Uh oh`, `Sorry about that`.

The app does not know whether the session went well, so it must not say. A bad
practice is still a practice, and `Nice work.` after a session the user knows
was rotten reads as an insult by a machine that was not listening. Settled in
[V1](#v1--the-app-never-says-how-the-session-went), which takes both that line
and `Ended early.` off the summary.

### 5. Punctuation

- **No em dashes and no double dashes.** The separator on screen is a middle
  dot with spaces: `Allegro · ♩ = 132`, `7:00 · 3 of 5`. It is already the app's
  house separator and it does the job an em dash was reaching for.
- **Ranges take `to`**, not a dash: `bars 12 to 14`.
- **Sentence case everywhere.** `Add piece or exercise`, not
  `Add Piece or Exercise`. Small caps eyebrows are a type token, not a
  capitalisation choice, so write them sentence case too and let `Eyebrow` style
  them.
- **No full stop on labels, buttons, titles or subtitles.** Full stops only on
  something that is genuinely a sentence (empty-state help, alert bodies).
- **Curly quotes for the user's words**, straight quotes never:
  `“Bars 12 to 14 rush every run past 88.”`
- **No ellipses** on buttons. A button that opens a sheet still names the action
  and nothing more.

### 6. Questions

A question mark is a promise that the user is about to decide something. Keep
the promise.

- **Fine**: `Discard this session?` on an alert; `How did Clair de Lune go?` on
  the reflection sheet. Both sit at a real decision.
- **Not fine**: a question as a screen title where there is no question, only a
  task. `Where do you want to focus?` above a list you build by tapping Add is
  the app pretending to interview the user. That is coach voice, and it is the
  register this whole doc exists to keep out.

### 7. Empty states

Three parts, in order, and nothing else: **what belongs here**, **what to do**,
and the action itself as a button where one exists. No apology, no explanation
of why it is empty.

Good, already shipped: `Your pieces and exercises will live here.` (fails
rule 3 on `Your`, right in every other way).

Never: `Nothing to see here`, `Looks like you haven't added anything yet!`.

### 8. Errors and destructive confirms

- Say what happened and what it means for the user's data, in that order.
  `Storage unavailable · changes this session won't be saved.` is the model.
- Never blame, never apologise, never expose a code.
- A confirm dialog names the consequence, not the mechanism: `This practice
  won't be saved.`, not `This will discard the session record`.
- Per [T6](design-principles.md#t6--reversible-by-default-vs-todays-confirm-sheets),
  most actions should not have a dialog at all. If you are writing confirm copy,
  first check the action is genuinely irreversible.

### 9. Length

Hard budgets, per surface:

- Screen title: **1 to 3 words.**
- Subtitle: **one line of facts**, no verb needed.
- Button: **1 to 4 words.**
- Empty state: **one sentence**, plus the button.
- Live view: **no prose at all** beyond labels and the item title.

If a string will not fit the budget, the screen is doing two things.

## Worked examples

The three the audit named. Options were put to Jon; the lean in each
was the one taken (2026-08-14), and the wording lands in the sweep.

### Library header

Currently: title `Library`, subtitle `4 pieces · 7 exercises`.

The title is already right by rule 3. The flagged "Your Library" energy is the
*header as a whole* reading like a filing cabinet: a room name and an inventory
count, neither of which is about music. The subtitle is the lever, not the title.

- **a. TAKEN.** Keep both. It is honest, it is short, and the rows below carry
  the interest.
- **b.** Keep `Library`, make the subtitle earn its line with something a
  musician would want at a glance: `Last added · Clair de Lune`, or the
  priorities count when any are starred.
- **c.** Title becomes the collection itself: `Pieces & exercises`, subtitle
  drops to counts only when filtered.

### Practice header and hero

Currently: title `Practice`, subtitle `12 sessions`, hero eyebrow `Today`,
hero title `A focused session`, hero caption `Tap to begin — one decision`.

Three separate problems:

- `A focused session` is the app describing its own intent. It is not a fact
  about the user and it says nothing (rule 3).
- `Tap to begin — one decision` breaks rule 5 (em dash) and rule 3 (it explains
  the interface to the person using it). The big circular play button is the
  affordance; a caption under it is chrome explaining chrome.
- The subtitle `12 sessions` is a lifetime total, which is trivia rather than
  orientation.

This is where [#1360](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/issues/1360) lands
(hero repurposed to last session plus one-tap start, subline becomes a relative
last-practised line). The wording to choose there:

- **a. TAKEN.** Hero title carries the real content, caption goes entirely:
  `Clair de Lune`, eyebrow `Last practised`, subline `Tuesday`. It is the
  user's data, in their words, and the button needs no caption.
- **b.** Eyebrow `Today`, title `Last practised Tuesday`, no caption.
- **c.** Keep an app-voice title but make it a fact: `Nothing since Tuesday`.

Header subtitle, independently: `Last practised Tuesday` beats `12 sessions`,
and beats both when there is nothing yet with `No sessions yet` (already
shipped, already right).

### Create form, the Piece/Exercise caption

Added with [#1361](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/issues/1361), which
the audit routed through this doc. Unlike the three above, no option was put to
Jon first: the doc had no worked example for a caption, so the wording was
written against the rules and is recorded here for the red pen.

The form asks for a type and leaves the distinction implicit, which is fine
once you know the app and opaque on your first item. Shipped:

| Selection | Caption |
|---|---|
| Piece | `Repertoire to learn and keep up` |
| Exercise | `Drills and studies to build technique` |

Both are noun-phrase-plus-purpose, so the two read as a comparison rather than
a definition and a list. No full stop (rule 5, they are labels), no possessive
(rule 3), a musician's words rather than the data model's (rule 2).

**The precedent this sets:** an explanatory caption is allowed on a *form*,
where the user is being asked to decide something and the app's vocabulary is
the thing in the way. It is not allowed in session, and it is not a licence to
caption a screen that could instead be clearer. If a caption is doing work a
better label would do, fix the label.

Open, for whenever the scaffold sheet is next touched: it mints exercises like
`Learn the melody` and `Constrained improv`
([#1389](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/issues/1389)), which no caption
about technique covers. That is the domain model's edge, not the copy's.

### Builder title

Currently: title `Build session`, subtitle the running summary
(`3 items · 25 min`) or `Editing`.

`Build session` is correct by every rule here: it names the task, it is two
words, it is sentence case, it does not narrate. The audit noted this title as
`Where do you want to focus?`, which is not in the codebase and never has been
(checked across all branches), so treat it as the register to avoid rather than
a string to replace. Rule 6 exists because of it.

- **a. TAKEN.** Leave it.
- **b.** `New session`, if `Build` reads like configuration rather than
  choosing what to play.

## The sweep checklist

For [#1359](https://github.com/jonyardley/intrada/issues/1359) step 2, and for
every PR that adds a string afterwards. Run it per string, not per screen.

- [ ] British spelling; `practise` verb / `practice` noun correct
- [ ] Uses the musician's word, not the core's (rule 2 table)
- [ ] No `Your` on chrome or in session (V2 allows it on reflective surfaces);
      no `View`/`Browse`/`Manage`; no app self-narration
- [ ] No banned word from rule 4; no exclamation mark; no `we`/`I`
- [ ] No em dash or double dash; separator is ` · `; ranges use `to`
- [ ] Sentence case; full stop only if it is a sentence
- [ ] A question mark only where the user is deciding
- [ ] Inside the rule 9 budget for its surface
- [ ] Accessibility label matches the visible string's tone (it is copy too)

## Decisions

Each one changes strings across several screens, so they were settled before
the sweep rather than during it. Append here rather than deciding silently, the
same way [`design-principles.md`](design-principles.md) keeps its T-log.

### V1 — The app never says how the session went

**Decided 2026-08-14 (Jon, #1359).** `Nice work.` goes, and so does its partner
`Ended early.`; the summary leads with the facts it actually has (duration,
items done, the scores the user entered).

The app has no microphone and no MIDI. Machine listening was deferred
(decision 18, 2026-08-04) and the capture spike was deleted outright in #1176,
leaving [`segmentation-findings.md`](segmentation-findings.md) as the record. So
the app's entire knowledge of a session is what the user typed into it, and
`Nice work.` currently fires on completion no matter what those numbers say.
Congratulating someone who scored every item 2 is the notebook claiming to have
listened.

Dropping only `Nice work.` would leave `Ended early.` reading as a rebuke by
contrast, which is why both go together. The intention quote already sits above
this line and does the framing better than either.

### V2 — Second person is for the user's own words only

**Decided 2026-08-14 (Jon, #1359).** Refines rule 3's first bullet, which as
drafted banned every `your`.

- **Reflective surfaces**: `you` and `your` allowed. `Your intention`,
  `What you played`, `Pick up where you left off?` all point at something the
  user actually did or wrote, and the possessive is doing real work.
- **Chrome and in session**: banned. `Your exercises` is the app labelling a
  room the user already knows is theirs.

The test is whether the possessive points at content the user authored. If it
points at a screen, cut it.

### V3 — `priorities`, never `starred`

**Decided 2026-08-14 (Jon, #1359).** The Library uses both for one concept today
(`Add to priorities` on the swipe, `Swipe a row to star it` in the empty state).
`priorities` wins because it names what the user meant; the star is the glyph
that shows it, not the word for it. The empty state changes in the sweep.

### V4 — The screen says `Mark`, the core keeps `score`

**Decided 2026-08-14 (Jon, #1359).** Rule 2 applied to the 0-to-10 rating.
`Score` means the printed music to every musician alive, and the app uses it for
how well something went.

`Mark` is the British word for a number saying how well you did, it is what an
exam board gives a performance, and it collides with nothing on screen. Per
rule 2 the core keeps `score` in its types, events and columns, so **this is a
copy change with no FFI, no migration and no bridge surface**. Swift view names
(`ScoreRing`, `ScoreSelector`) are shell-local and may be renamed for
consistency or left alone; neither is load-bearing.

Considered and rejected: `Grade`, which collides with ABRSM grades (the level,
not the mark); `Rating`, which is accurate but is the data model's word, not a
musician's.
