```

Test tiering, worktree simulator isolation, and the green-stamp skip (which lets
a recipe no-op when HEAD is already stamped green at that tier) are documented in
[`ios-testing.md`](ios-testing.md).

### Binding regeneration

`just ios` and `just ios-run` auto-regenerate the Swift bindings only when
`intrada-core` or `intrada-ffi` changed (a `ios/generated/.gen-stamp` hash), so
they stay in sync without slowing pure-Swift edits. `just ios-gen` forces a full
regenerate. A stale `.gen-stamp` is the tell when iOS tests behave oddly after a
core type change.

### Swift formatting

`just ios-fmt-check` covers the hand-written trees (`ios/Intrada`,
`ios/IntradaTests`, `ios/IntradaUITests`) with the toolchain-bundled
`swift format` on default config. `ios/generated` is excluded — generated
bindings are never hand-edited. The one-time whole-tree reformat commit is listed
in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`; run this once so `git blame` skips it:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

### Logging

`just ios-logs` filters the unified log to `subsystem == "com.intrada.native"`,
cutting the simulator's UIKit/keyboard/gesture noise so first-party signal is
visible. `report(_:)` (`ios/Intrada/Core/Logging.swift`) logs swallowed FFI and
bincode bridge errors there. That is the silent-no-op class (#846), which
otherwise leaves no trace anywhere Sentry has no DSN: CI always, and dev unless
`SENTRY_DSN_NATIVE` is set.

### TestFlight

`just testflight` builds a signed Release `.ipa` and uploads it to TestFlight
(internal testing), mirroring `.github/workflows/release-testflight.yml` (which
runs on `workflow_dispatch` or a `v*` tag, never per-PR). Signing is fastlane
**match**, and it needs Ruby >= 3 — system Ruby 2.6 is too old, use `rbenv` —
plus a one-time App Store Connect and match bootstrap. Full setup and decisions:
[`../specs/ios-testflight-cicd.md`](../specs/ios-testflight-cicd.md) and
SETUP.md §6a.

### Git hooks

Git hooks install automatically for Claude Code sessions (a `SessionStart` hook
runs `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`). They catch the "pushed onto a merged-PR
branch and the commits orphaned" pitfall via a pre-push check against `gh`, and
flag comment-bloat. Manual install, forking setup, and first-time iOS setup are
in the [README](../README.md#prerequisites) — read that before your first
`just ios`.

### Demo data vs real on-device data

A plain launch (`just ios` then Cmd+R on the default **Intrada** scheme, or any
build with no launch args) runs **local-first**: the Library hydrates from the
on-device GRDB store, so items you add survive restarts.

The 6 sample pieces are **opt-in** via the `--seed-sample-data` launch arg. In
Xcode, pick the **Intrada (Seeded)** scheme from the scheme dropdown (defined in
`ios/project.yml`) and Cmd+R; the selection persists across `just ios`
regenerations. `just ios-run` passes the same arg by default (`SEED=1`); use
`SEED=0 just ios-run` to launch against your real data.

Seed mode (`Event::LoadSampleData`) replaces the model with demo items and
**skips store hydration**, so don't use it when testing persistence. Your saved
rows are still on disk but won't be read back.

## Knowledge graph (graphify)

The graph lives in the **main checkout** at `graphify-out/` (gitignored, so
worktrees don't carry it). Find the main checkout from any worktree via
`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`, then take its parent.

Scope is controlled by the committed `.graphifyignore`: vendored and minified JS,
`specs/_archive/`, `.specify/`, and generated schemas are excluded.

```bash
graphify query "<question>"   # from the main checkout root
graphify path A B             # trace how two concepts connect
graphify . --update           # refresh after a doc-heavy merge
```

The post-commit and post-checkout hooks in the main checkout do free AST-only
code refreshes automatically. Run `graphify . --update` manually after doc-heavy
merges (specs/, docs/, CLAUDE.md); it is incremental and content-hash cached, so
it costs a small fraction of a full build.

## Environment variables

### API (intrada-api)

`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` (required), `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` (required
in prod), `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` (see SETUP.md §2), `PORT` (default 3001).

### R2 photo storage (optional)

The API starts without these; photo endpoints return 500 until they are set.
`R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`,
`R2_PUBLIC_URL`. See SETUP.md §3 for provisioning.

### Native iOS build (compile-time)

`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `INTRADA_API_URL` (default
`https://intrada-api.fly.dev`).

### Native iOS (optional): Sentry

`SENTRY_DSN_NATIVE` in `.env` captures crash and error events from local dev
builds, tagged `environment=development`. The plumbing is fiddly and was silently
broken once, so the whole chain is worth stating:

1. `xcodegen` writes the value to the `SENTRY_DSN` build setting.
2. The target's partial `Info.plist` (`ios/Intrada/Info.plist`) carries
   `SENTRY_DSN = $(SENTRY_DSN)` so the value lands in the built plist.
3. The justfile's `set dotenv-load` feeds the var in.

Step 2 is the non-obvious one: a custom key **cannot** ride `INFOPLIST_KEY_*`,
which `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` only honours for Apple-recognised keys. That gap
meant Sentry silently never started.

It is **unset in CI**, so test and smoke runs send nothing. The app only starts
Sentry on a real `https://` DSN, so an empty or unexpanded value is a safe no-op.

## Gotchas, in full

### JSON-only serde attrs break the Crux bincode FFI bridge

The native iOS shell exchanges `Event` / `Effect` / `ViewModel` with the core as
**positional bincode**, a non-self-describing format. serde attributes that only
make sense for a self-describing format (JSON) silently corrupt that wire: the
Swift side serializes every field and level by structure, but a JSON-oriented
deserializer reads a different shape, **misaligns the byte stream, and the whole
event fails to decode**. `Store.send` swallows the bridge error via `guarded`, so
the symptom is a silent no-op — "editing doesn't save" (#846) — not a crash.

The specific offender we hit was `#[serde(deserialize_with = "double_option")]`
on `UpdateItem`'s three-state `Option<Option<T>>` fields. `double_option` reads a
single option level, which is right for JSON (a present key is one `Option<T>`,
and `null` means clear), but bincode needs both levels.

The fix: make such helpers **format-aware** via
`Deserializer::is_human_readable()`, with a JSON branch and a bincode branch, so
the same type round-trips on both wires.

Rules of thumb for any type crossing the bridge (`Event`, `Effect`, `ViewModel`,
and everything they contain):

- Be wary of `deserialize_with` / `serialize_with`, and of `skip_serializing_if`
  combined with non-trailing fields — anything assuming "absent" versus "present"
  semantics. bincode has no "absent".
- **Stub-bridge tests can't catch this.** Cover bridge-crossing types with a
  *real*-bridge round-trip (`LiveBridge` in `StoreEffectLoopTests`) that drives
  the actual Swift↔Rust bincode serialization. See
  `testRealBridgeEditAppliesToViewModel`.

### `option_env!` needs `cargo:rerun-if-env-changed`

If a build script — or an `option_env!` site indirectly, via macro expansion —
reads an env var, pair it with `println!("cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=NAME")` in
`build.rs`. Without it, cargo caches the macro expansion across builds and your
"I changed the env var" rebuild silently uses stale values. We have hit this on
`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `INTRADA_API_URL`.

## Why agent teams were retired (#1223)

In-session agent teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`,
`/team-vertical`) were tried on #1223 and retired. On a slice coupled by a bridge
contract, the split cost more than it bought. Measured on that PR:

- **The halves were never independent.** One genuinely parallel window of about
  25 minutes, against roughly 20 coordination messages, three nudges to idle
  teammates, and three replies to superseded instructions.
- **The split caused the worst bug in the PR.** The shell teammate restarted the
  click without bumping `pulse_seq`, because it could not see the core invariant
  that says a restart is signalled by that field. It then rebuilt the hardest
  code in the slice from scratch. One agent holding both sides would not have
  written it.
- **The quality came from elsewhere**: adversarial review, the pre-push comment
  hook, and mutation-testing vacuous tests. All three work with one agent.

The rule that came out of it — one agent per vertical slice, fan out only on
genuinely independent work — is in `skill://intrada-parallel-streams`.

## Where #1256 Phase B's time actually went (2026-08-07)

A retrospective measured rather than estimated, after Phase B felt slow. It is
the source of the split-the-phase rule, the wire-shape gate, the shared fixtures
and `just ios-snapshots-record`.

**The tooling was not the bottleneck.** Timed on the worktree that built it:

| Loop | Wall clock |
|------|-----------|
| `just ios-test`, warm | 43s |
| `just ios-test` after one Swift edit | 31s |
| One scoped test via `_ios-test-without-building` | 24s |
| Whole CI run | ~10 min |

Roughly, across about two hours: writing code and tests ~55%, review-and-then-
re-run-everything ~20%, local gates ~15%, flakes and dead ends ~10%.

**What actually cost time, in order:**

1. **One PR for a phase spanning core and screens.** 4,300 insertions, seven
   designed frames, a bridge change and a migration. Both self-review blockers
   were in core code written in the first third; finding them at the end meant
   re-running every gate and rebasing onto a main that had moved.
2. **Reviewing once, at the end.** `requesting-code-review` says "review early,
   often". A review after the core landed would have caught both blockers before
   any SwiftUI existed.
3. **The field-addition tax.** Adding `origin` to `BlockSpec`/`BlockRecord` broke
   six construction sites, each found by a separate build, because errors were
   read one at a time rather than with `cargo check --all-targets`.
4. **Snapshot recording by hand.** Delete, run, run, optimise, check — five
   steps, done five times. `ios-snapshots-optimize` over the whole suite cost
   more than the test run it followed (94s → 50s once scoped).
5. **Fighting the size ceiling before reading it.** Four cycles trying crops on
   gradient-heavy references, when `check-snapshots.sh`'s own comment says
   cropping cannot help those.

**Tests, judged honestly.** Duration is fine. One real flake —
`ClickEngineTests` stands up an `AVAudioEngine` inside a merge gate (#1282).
The simulator's own "Busy / preflight checks" cost four local cycles. And the
criterion parser's fourteen green unit tests all used sentences written to match
the scanner, which is why it shipped misreading the likeliest real one.

**What was worth keeping**: the code-reviewer subagent (two blockers for
fourteen minutes), driving the simulator rather than trusting green tests, TDD
on the core, and reading the spec and mockups properly.

## Why the native iOS CI is shaped the way it is (2026-09-03)

The native iOS gate fans out (#1207): **Native iOS: build** compiles once and
uploads the built test products, the test jobs run against that artifact, and the
fan-in job **Native iOS (build + test)** stays the required status check. Timed
across three pull-request runs that touched the app, the critical path was
**Path Changes** (10s), then the build job (339-451s), then **Native iOS: UI**
(702-739s): roughly 19 to 20 minutes of wall clock. Inside the build job,
regenerating bindings cost 54s (only when the core changed),
`build-for-testing` 86s, toolchain and cache setup about 90s, and the Release
compile guard 155-197s.

The run that landed the changes below came in at **11m26s** end to end: build
162s, then the longer UI slice at 495s. One number to keep in mind before
slicing the UI suite again: the two slices took 436s for three tests and 495s
for four, so the cost is per test rather than per class, and a further split
keeps paying until the per-test stall itself is fixed (#947).

What those numbers changed:

- **The Release guard runs beside the tests, not in front of them.** The
  `#if DEBUG` divergence check (#1177) was 155-197s of that critical path and
  nothing downstream reads what it produces, so it moved to a sibling job,
  `native-ios-build-release`, which starts when the build job finishes and runs
  concurrently with the two test jobs. It keeps its own DerivedData cache
  (`ios-dd-release-v1-*`) and is listed in the fan-in gate, so a Release-only
  break still fails the required check. This is the trade #1207 parked in
  2026-08 until "the full tier's wall time grows past ~10 minutes", which 19
  to 20 minutes clears: the price paid is more concurrent macOS jobs (four
  rather than two, billed at 10x) and the artifact downloaded by each test
  job, in exchange for the wall clock.
- **The test jobs stopped generating the Xcode project.** Both now run
  `xcodebuild test-without-building -xctestrun <path>` against the `.xctestrun`
  inside the downloaded `native-ios-test-products` artifact. That file is
  self-describing: it names the test bundles, the host app and the environment
  to launch them in, so running the tests needs no `.xcodeproj` and no scheme.
  Dropping project generation takes xcodegen, the `ios/generated` bindings
  restore and the 928 MB SwiftPM cache out of both jobs, and with no project to
  open there is no package graph to resolve, so nothing can re-clone the
  dependencies over the network (the #813 flake that restore guarded against).
- **The UI suite runs as two sliced jobs.** Seven XCUITests across four
  classes were taking 653-692s serially, the longest single step in the
  pipeline, and `SessionBuilderUITests` is over a third of that on its own
  (#947). **Native iOS: UI** is now a two-entry matrix: one slice runs that
  class, the other runs its complement, expressed as `-skip-testing:` so a UI
  class added later joins the second slice rather than silently running
  nowhere (the #1456 failure mode). xcodebuild's own parallel testing was
  tried first and rejected: it clones the destination simulator, and the
  clone's test runner failed to launch with "Application failed preflight
  checks (Busy)" under memory pressure, which reds the gate for no test
  reason. Slicing does not explain the idle stalls in the suite, which stay
  open as #947.
- **The Actions cache was over its ceiling.** The repo held 10.69 GB across 48
  entries against GitHub's 10 GB per-repo LRU limit, so entries were being
  evicted while runs still wanted them, which is the suspected cause of the
  unit + snapshot job's 225-509s spread. `ios-dd-*` accounted for 19 entries and
  4.36 GB, `ios-spm-*` for 3 entries and 2.79 GB (928 MB each), because caches
  are written per ref and every pull-request branch was saving its own copy. A
  scheduled **Cache Prune** workflow (`.github/workflows/cache-prune.yml`) now
  keeps the newest few entries per key family, and the iOS build caches restore
  on every ref but save only on main.
- **`save-if` is not an `actions/cache` input.** The DerivedData step had
  carried `save-if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}` and a comment
  saying "only main writes the cache" for months; an unknown input is silently
  ignored, so main-only writing never happened, which is how 19 `ios-dd-*`
  entries against six different refs accumulated. Proof after the fact:
  `refs/pull/1521/merge` wrote an `ios-dd-v2-*` entry on 2026-09-04 with that
  line in place. The mechanism that does work is
  `actions/cache/restore@v6` plus a separate `actions/cache/save@v6` step
  gated by `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`. `save-if` **is** a real
  rust-cache input, which is what made the mistake easy to keep: the same
  spelling means something in one action and nothing in the other. Check a
  cache rule by listing the refs that wrote its entries, never by reading the
  workflow.
- **Clippy had been asking for a cache nothing ever wrote.** rust-cache composes
  its key as `<prefix-key>-<job-name>-<arch>-…`, so `prefix-key: native` with
  `save-if: "false"` looked for `native-clippy-…` while the only entries in the
  repo were `native-test-Linux-x64-…` from **Test** and
  `native-ios-native-ios-build-Darwin-arm64-…` from the iOS build. It
  cold-compiled the workspace on every run. It now uses `prefix-key: clippy`,
  saving on main only, so pull requests restore main's copy. The general point:
  a rust-cache key carries the job name, so a `save-if: false` reader can only
  share with the *same* job on another ref, never with a different job.

## The API image build stopped caching its layers (2026-09-04)

**API Docker Build** exported a buildkit layer cache to GitHub Actions
(`cache-to: type=gha,mode=max`). One run of it wrote 26 `buildkit-blob-*`
entries and 1.96 GB, a fifth of the repo's 10 GB allowance, for a lane that
only runs when the API changes and is on hold behind the iOS pivot. Neither
mode was worth that:

- `mode=max` caches every intermediate layer, which is what made it 1.96 GB.
- `mode=min` caches only what the final image exports, and the `Dockerfile` is
  a cargo-chef build whose expensive layer (`cargo chef cook --release`) lives
  in the `builder` stage, so `mode=min` would export the runtime stage and
  never the layer the file is designed around.

So the lane builds with no layer cache at all. A cold build measured **139s**,
which is cheaper than it looks because the allowance it frees is restored by
every iOS pull request. If the API comes back into focus, `mode=max` plus a
prune rule that treats the blobs and their index as one all-or-nothing set is
the shape to add: deleting blobs while keeping the index that names them
produces buildkit's `blob not found` import failure rather than a cold build.

## Mutate-response variants, in full

Writes reconcile with the server response directly, with no full-list refetch.
Three create variants live in the codebase.

**Temp-id mutate-response** (`Item`) — the default for new entities. The domain
handler pushes the optimistic entry with a client-generated ulid; the HTTP
wrapper carries that ulid; the `*Created { temp_id, entity }` event replaces the
optimistic entry, since the server-assigned ulid differs from the client one.

**Client-owned ulid** (`Session`) — the client ulid is the canonical id. POST is
fire-and-forget: `SessionSaved` just clears the error state and the model keeps
the optimistic write.

**Save-counter + refetch** (`Set`) — designed as optimistic push, bump
`set_saves_committed`, then a full refetch via `SetSaveSucceeded`, with the
counter driving a save-form's optimistic-to-confirmed UI flip. **Shell-dead
since the coach-pivot builder deletion (#1344):** no Swift screen sends a
`SetEvent`, and `domain/set.rs` fires HTTP unconditionally with no
`local_first` branch. Tracked in #1348 — don't wire a new caller to it, and
don't copy this variant for a new entity, until that's resolved.

Updates use `*Updated { entity }` (the server echoes the row). Deletes use
`DeleteConfirmed`, since the model is already mutated optimistically.

## Glossary

Process words that recur in docs, issues and PR bodies. Feature names don't
belong here: they follow the plain-language rule (CLAUDE.md → Conventions),
which names the musician-visible outcome and allows a codename in brackets
once.

- **slice** — the smallest independently shippable piece of a feature; each
  one is shipped and used before the next is built.
- **stream** — one line of work in one worktree and session; *vertical* means
  core + iOS together.
- **tier** — ceremony level per CLAUDE.md Workflow: 1 just do it, 2 plan
  mode, 3 spec first.
- **worktree** — a separate git checkout so parallel streams don't collide.
- **bridge** — the generated FFI boundary (Event / Effect / ViewModel)
  between the Rust core and the Swift shell.
- **local-first** — works offline against the on-device store; no HTTP on
  the path.
- **projection / derived** — computed from existing session history; no new
  stored data.
- **shell-dead** — core code no Swift screen calls any more; a deletion
  candidate (the #1348 pattern).

## Why mutation-test by deletion, not inversion (#1423)

Two derivations shipped in a PR whose own author had "mutation-tested" both by
inverting them. The reviewer deleted each and the full 695-test suite stayed
green. One of the two, replaced with its naive form, would have silently
dropped a tempo the user had earned. Inverting is the weaker mutation because
a reversed sort fails any assertion about order whether or not the test
actually constrains anything — deleting the line (or substituting the naive
version a future reader would plausibly write) is what surfaces a test that
passes for the wrong reason. The resulting rule is in CLAUDE.md under
*Testing*.

## Why hand-picked test cases hid a real bug (#1256)

The coach-era criterion parser shipped with fourteen green unit tests and
still read "three clean passes **in a row**" as the key of A, which at two
keys silently doubled the gate. Every one of those tests used a sentence
written to match the scanner, so they agreed with the implementation by
construction instead of constraining it. The fix is to write the test table
as inputs a *user* would actually produce and assert the property the next
stage needs. The resulting rule is in CLAUDE.md under *Testing*.

## Why #1214 got two independent implementations (2026-08-07)

#1214 got two complete independent implementations (#1243, #1247) fifteen
hours apart. The merged one was the weaker, and #1250 had to port back what
was lost. The issue carried no assignee, label or comment, and nothing
required looking at the one live claim signal, which is an open PR.
`just status` now puts both signals on one screen. The resulting claim
protocol is in CLAUDE.md under *Always*(1).
