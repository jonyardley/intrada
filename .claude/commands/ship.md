description: Run the pre-push gates and the self-review before opening or updating a PR. The mechanics live in the intrada-shipping skill; this fixes the order.
---

Prepare the current branch to ship. Read `.claude/skills/intrada-shipping/SKILL.md` first: it is the source for every step below.

1. **Gates**, through the `test-runner` agent: `just check`, plus `just ios-fmt-check` and `just ios-test-full` when files under `ios/` changed. Stop at the first failure and report its actual output.
2. **Self-review**, before the push: the `reviewer` agent over the local diff, pinned to Sonnet 5 high. Check `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD | grep -E 'intrada-ffi|ios/generated|LibraryStore.swift|domain/session.rs'`; a hit spawns it with `model: opus` instead (or Fable for Fable-written work). Fix blockers inline.
3. **Deferred items**: open an issue for each before posting the review comment.
4. **Open the PR** as a draft with the body template from the skill, post the review summary citing the agent, then mark it ready.
5. **Watch CI** to a conclusion in the same turn, and read the PR's mergeability, not just the job list.
