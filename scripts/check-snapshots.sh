#  1. Orphans: every __Snapshots__/<Class>/<method>.N.png must map to a
#     `func <method>` in ios/IntradaTests/<Class>.swift. A renamed or deleted
#     test leaves a dead PNG that bloats git history forever — fail so it's
#     pruned with the test.
#  2. Size ceiling: a reference over SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES is almost always an
#     un-optimized PNG (Xcode writes a redundant all-opaque alpha channel;
#     `just ios-snapshots-optimize` strips it losslessly, ~75% smaller). Fail so
#     it's optimized before it lands, keeping per-record history growth low.
