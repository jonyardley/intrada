# with no comment to identify an owner, or an open PR on a different branch
# already references it (#1702). Before this, adding the label to an
# already-labelled issue succeeded silently and a claim comment could land
# on top of another session's: two sessions built the same greeting on
# 2026-09-11 (#1694) because nothing caught either.
#
# Two or more merged PRs already referencing the issue is a fix loop, the
# strongest signal the framing is wrong (#1890: the page-crop bug took three
# fix PRs and eleven sessions before a decision ended it). A third claim is
# refused unless the decision taken is named.

# Called via `just claim <number> [decision]`.
