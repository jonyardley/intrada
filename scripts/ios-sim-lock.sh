# Machine-wide advisory lock serialising iOS Simulator test runs (#1622).
# CoreSimulatorService and SpringBoard are machine-global, so two
# xcodebuild/XCTest runs against DISTINCT simulator devices can still crash
# each other's XCUITests (#1192, measured in #1621), so this lock is the sole
# busy signal now. It replaces check-sim-free.sh's "any booted simulator"
# heuristic, which false-positived on a leftover-but-idle sim nobody shut
# down after an earlier run: a booted device no longer means anything by
# itself, only holding this lock does.
#
# A second caller WAITS rather than refusing outright, since the wait is
# short relative to the cost of an aborted gate and a manual restart
# (#1622). `mkdir` is the lock primitive (atomic on every filesystem this
# runs on) rather than `flock`, which macOS does not ship.
#
# Usage, from a caller that traps EXIT to release:
#   source scripts/ios-sim-lock.sh
#   ios_sim_lock_acquire
#   trap ios_sim_lock_release EXIT
#
# IOS_SIM_LOCK_DIR and IOS_SIM_LOCK_TIMEOUT override the path and wait, in
# seconds, both for tests, so this can be exercised without a 900s wait.

# A crashed holder (kill -9, a yanked machine) never runs its EXIT trap, so a
# dead PID means the lock is stale, not held.
